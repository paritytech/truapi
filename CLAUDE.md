# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

This repo is the single source of truth for the TrUAPI protocol. It vendors `dotli` as a git submodule at `hosts/dotli/`.

## Layout

```
rust/crates/
  truapi/                Rust trait + type definitions for protocol versions v0.1 and v0.2
  truapi-codegen/        rustdoc JSON → TypeScript client + Rust dispatcher
  truapi-macros/         #[wire(id = N)] proc-macro
js/packages/
  truapi/         @parity/truapi TS package; src/generated/ produced by truapi-codegen
playground/              Next.js interactive playground; deploys to truapi-playground.dot
hosts/dotli/             dotli submodule
docs/                    design docs, RFCs, feature proposals
scripts/codegen.sh       regenerate the TS client from the Rust crate
```

## Code style

- Every `pub` Rust item (functions, methods, types, traits, modules, constants) carries a doc comment (`///` or `//!`).
  Keep it short and focused on intent or invariants, not on what the signature already says.
- Do not add code comments or doc comments that narrate migrations, compatibility shims, or historical changes. Comments should describe only the current code.
- Remove legacy compatibility code by default. Keep or add it only when explicitly requested.
- In Rust format strings, prefer inlined variables: `"log value: {value:?}"` over `"log value: {:?}", value`.

## First-time setup

```bash
# Check out the dotli submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the TypeScript client (triggers tsc via `prepare`)
( cd js/packages/truapi && npm install )

# Install playground dependencies (picks up @parity/truapi via the file: link)
( cd playground && yarn install --frozen-lockfile )
```

## Regenerating the TS client

When the Rust trait surface changes, rerun:

```bash
./scripts/codegen.sh
```

That will repopulate `js/packages/truapi/src/generated/`. Commit the regenerated files alongside the Rust changes.
It also regenerates playground metadata in `js/packages/truapi/src/playground/codegen/`.
After regenerating, rebuild the client and refresh the playground's link copy:

```bash
( cd js/packages/truapi && npm run build )
( cd playground && rm -rf node_modules/@parity && yarn install )
```

(yarn 1.x copies `file:` deps at install time, so the playground's `node_modules/@parity/truapi` is a snapshot.)

## Local development

### Rust

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo +nightly fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

### TypeScript client

```bash
cd js/packages/truapi
npm run build
npm test                # wire-equality + wire-table-loop smoke tests
```

### Playground

```bash
cd playground
yarn dev                # Next.js dev server on :3000
yarn build              # static export to out/
yarn lint
```

The playground must be opened from inside a TrUAPI host. The fastest local
setup is to run dotli's preview server alongside the playground and open
`http://localhost:5173/localhost:3000` in any browser. Use the
[`playground-local-stack`](.claude/skills/playground-local-stack/SKILL.md)
skill to bring both servers up in tmux (it handles the `hosts/dotli/`
submodule init + `bun install` and the per-pane `cd` discipline).
Alternatively, with a deployed Polkadot Desktop Host installed, navigate to
`https://dot.li/localhost:3000` from within it.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger `.github/workflows/deploy-playground.yml`, which builds `playground/` and publishes the static export to `truapi-playground.dot` via `bulletin-deploy`.
Pushes to `main` also trigger `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`, which publishes the Rust API docs to GitHub Pages.
